    <p class="content-h-one">
      The most basic components of soil are minerals, organic matter, water and air. Soil minerals and organic matter
      hold and store nutrients, soil water and moves nutrients to plants and air plays an integral role, since many of
      the microorganisms need air to undergo the biological processes that release nutrients into the soil. Soil organic
      matter (SOM) not only stores nutrients in the soil but also is a direct source of nutrients. Its presence is
      considered an important indicator of fertile soil.
    </p>

    <p class="content-h-one">
      Minerals and organic matter are generally stable although, if not managed properly, may soon be depleted from the
      soil. The water and air components, however, are more dynamic and constantly change as the soil becomes wet or
      dry.

      Nutrient balance sheets in most soils of India have been deficient and continue to be so. This is primarily
      because nutrient removals by crops far exceed the nutrient additions through manures and fertilisers. For the past
      50 years the gap between removals and additions has been estimated at 8 to 10 Million meteric tonnes of <span

      While chemical fertilizers have their place increasing plant nutrients in adverse weather conditions or during
      times when plants need additional nutrients, there are also several harmful effects of chemical fertilizers. Some
      of the harm chemical fertilizers may cause include waterway pollution, chemical burn to crops, increased air
      pollution, acidification of the soil and mineral depletion of the soil.

      So we can imply that if we add it in less or more proportion, in both ways its going to affect the environment,
      and then the soil.

      The project will focus on providing with all the information that one needs to know for growing crops, i.e.
      nturient content, water content and ph value of soil, so that one can easily add fertilizers, and water
      accordingly.
